The Weather App uses the Visual Crossing API to fetch weather data based on user input. Users can toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius, with a dynamic interface that updates visuals based on conditions. It emphasizes API integration, async/await, secure practices, and includes optional features like loading indicators for improved user experience.
